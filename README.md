### üìÉ Description
Do you play [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/)? Do you like keeping a screenshot archive of your best drops in the game?
If you do, then you may find this application useful.

The application simply displays a clean, small window that awaits for a file to be dragged onto it.
Once it receives a file, it prompts the user for the type of bag or drop shown in the screenshot.
It then asks for the name(s) of the rare item(s) received in the loot bag(s).

The application will then use this information, coupled with the file's metadata, to generate a new file name.
The new name is meant to help with organization.
Assuming all of your screenshots are contained within the same folder, they should display in chronological order.

### ‚ùì F.A.Q.
__What is Realm of the Mad God?__

>For more information on Realm of the Mad God, or RotMG‚Ñ¢, please visit the [wiki](https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/realm-of-the-mad-god).

__Why does the application always hover over other windows?__

>It defaults to an  __Always on Top__  behavior which keeps it in front of other windows you have opened, even if those windows are in focus.
This is usually preferred, as you are dragging and dropping files from your system's file explorer.
However, if you want to get the application out of the way, simply minimize or close it.
A setting to toggle this behavior is likely to be implemented in the future.

__Can I change the file renaming format? What about the date format?__

>Currently, you cannot. There are no configurable settings at the moment. However, this will likely change in the future.

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Future Plans/Ideas
These are not concrete plans. These changes may or may not be implemented in the future and are subject to change.
For the most up-to-date information surrounding new features, please use the [Issues](https://github.com/Minimunch57/ROTMG-Screenshot-Organizer/issues) or [Projects](https://github.com/Minimunch57/ROTMG-Screenshot-Organizer/projects?query=is%3Aopen) pages.
- [x] Add more options for loot drop types (Red Bag, Purple Bag (?), Other)
- [ ] Automatic Detection
    - [ ] Detect which rare items dropped in the screenshot.
    - [ ] Detect which bag the loot dropped in.
      - This could be done in the opposite direction by first determining the item, then using the bag which that item drops in.
- [ ] Settings Configuration
    - [ ] Always on Top Behavior
    - [ ] Renaming Format (including Date Format)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information
The 'White Bag' art used as this application's icon is directly from the game, Realm of the Mad God (RotMG‚Ñ¢).
All credit goes to the current (DECA Live Operations GmbH) and past (Kabam, Wild Shadow Studios, etc.) developers of the game, including, most notably, the art team(s).
Full development history and credits can be viewed on the game's official, yet unaffiliated, wiki page called [RealmEye](https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/development).

The application was designed to work on Windows systems, but it is possible that it may work on other operating systems.
However, do this at your own risk, as there has *only* been testing performed on Windows machines.
